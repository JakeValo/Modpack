- Test all boss fights and make sure they're balanced, also check out some of the weapons and make sure they're balanced aswell, not too strong, but not too weak.
  - When you load into a world, press esc, on the bottom left will be a list of all the bosses in the game.
- Keep in mind the weapon / items you need to beat a certain boss and if its mid-game or late game.
  - If a boss is a late game boss but can be beaten with an easy to craft weapon, then its imbalanced.
  - If a boss is early game but can only be beaten with a late game weapon, it's also imbalanced.
  - Bosses have to be balanced, matched early-game and matched late-game.
- If you find that some of the bosses were too weak or too strong, note it down, same goes with weapons.
= Find any imbalances in the game at all.
- Walk around the world and look for any glitches / oddities. This can include:
  - Cut terrain
  - Random places where performance is affected heavily, hard stuttered, franed drops, etc.
  - Chunks not loading

If you come across any issues while testing, inform me. 
Any extra ideas is also appreciated.
