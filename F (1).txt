
INSTRUCTIONS READ:
- Test all boss fights and make sure they're balanced, also check out some of the weapons and make sure they're balanced aswell, not too strong, but not too weak.
  - When you load into a world, press esc, on the bottom left will be a list of all the bosses in the game.
- If you find that some of the bosses were too weak or too strong, note it down, same goes with weapons.
- Walk around the world and look for any glitches / oddities. This can include:
  - Cut terrain
  - Random places where performance is affected heavily
  - Chunks not loading

If you come across any issues while testing, inform me.
